# adventofcode2018

Goals:
 * Everything functional and immutable (no _vars_ nor mutable collections)
 * Answers must be presented as variables in the top-level scope, perhaps wrapped in a Option or single sized collection
 * No dependencies, only Scala stdlib
 
Non-goals:
 * Make the code as readable as possible, although I'll definitely try!
 * Make the code as short/concise as possible, although I'll probably try (while keeping it readable)
 * Over-defensive input parsing. I consider the input to be clean and according to the assignment's specifications.
